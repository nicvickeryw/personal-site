                    I'm a skilled, driven and motivated software developer from
                    Wollongong, NSW.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working as for Padua Financial Group, where I
                    use PHP alongside SilverStripe for our back-end RESTful API
                    development, alongside an Angular 2+ front-end system, all
                    hosted on local machines or AWS microservices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a full-stack developer, my development toolkit includes a
                    wide variety of languages like JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP,
                    HTML/SCSS, C# .NET, with a specialisation in the former two.
                    Although my speciality lies in building fluid and responsive
                    UIs, I have a background in network design & architecture.
